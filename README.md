# Automate_Boring_stuff
<hr>

Following the Udemy Course 'Automate the Boring Stuff' by ['Al Sweigart'](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/#instructor-1)

For me, it's a great refresher for working with files, OS, and RegEx, but it's also a great introduction to newer concepts for me like Logging, shelves, and shutil.
It helps me better understand the myrida Python libraries, and my own machine.

It comes with plenty of practical applications, and I can't wait to use them!
